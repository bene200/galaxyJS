# galaxyJS
A Javascript library for interacting with the Galaxy API

Right now it's just a single class and provides only very limited functionality. I add new functionality as I need it.

If you, like me, find yourself wanting to use the Galaxy API in your Javascript projects I'd be happy to get in touch.


## How to use

```
git clone
```

```js
var Galaxy = require("path/to/galaxyJS/lib/galaxy");
var g = new Galaxy(baseURL, apiKey);
```
